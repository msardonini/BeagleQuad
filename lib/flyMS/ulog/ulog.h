 * @brief Class to handle the logging of data to a file in the ULog data format
 * (https://docs.px4.io/main/en/dev_log/ulog_file_format.html). The interface is relatively simple. The user
 * instantiates the object, runs the init() member function once, and then repeatedly calls the `write_msg()`
 * member function to record the data to a file. The user can then use the `px4tools` python package to read the data
 * from the file (typically it is converted to a CSV file). To increase the performance of the logging, the interaction
 * with the file system is done in a separate thread. This way, the control thread doesn't get backed up with I/O
 * flushing
